## Basic git commands

1. `git clone <url>` - Clones the repository onto your system

2. `git add <fileName>` - Using this command will tell git to add any changes made to this file so that when you create a new `commit`, it'll include the changes you've made here.  
  A way to add all changes made in any files is: `git add .`

3. `git commit -m "commit message"` - This will save all the changes you've asked git to track (using `add`) in your `local` repository. The commit message is basically a brief explanation of your commit.

4. `git pull` - This will get any changes that have been made to the github repository, or the `remote` repository.

5. `git push origin master` - This isn't exactly the root form of this command. It's more `git push <remote> <branch>`. It pushes the `branch`, which is master, to our `remote`, which is origin.
